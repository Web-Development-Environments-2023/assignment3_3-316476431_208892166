      "In a big pot (a cocotte if you have one), put in the rice and water. Bring it to a boil.When it comes to a boiling point, give it a good stir. Put in some salt and the sliced ginger. Then, put the lid on. Turn the heat to low.Check and stir from time to time. It takes probably 20-30 minutes for the grains to start breaking. If you use Jasmine rice, it will be quicker. Long grain rice like basmati takes slightly longer.",
      "Let it cook for about 1.5-2 hours. Remember to stir and check the consistency. If it becomes too thick, add some water. I usually tend not not make it too runny. The consistency that I always look for is like something like the consistency of pancake batter.Once it has been cooked under low heat for about 2 hours with desired consistency achieved, stir in the cod/haddock fillet that has been cut into cubes.",
